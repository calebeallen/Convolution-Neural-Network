# Convolution Neural Network

Note: This model is not optimized as it runs on the CPU opposed to GPU. This model is strictly for proof of concept.

This is a simple and fully customizable Convolution Neural Network. This type of machine learning model is commonly used for image processing and classification. 

This model utilizes modern techniques to improve training speed and convergence. When given simple test data, the model was able to converge in under 100 training iterations as opposed to my last model that took several thousands of training iterations to converge when given the same data. 

This image shows the network's increase in performace after 90 training iterations (100 training examples per iteration):
